Results of custom groupers



group by function (task.heading + '.md' === task.file.filename) ? '' : task.heading
Group by heading, but only if the heading differs from the file name.
This works well immediately after a 'group by filename' line.
Note the three equals signs '===': these are important for safety in JavaScript.
